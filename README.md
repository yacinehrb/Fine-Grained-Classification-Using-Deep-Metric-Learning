# Fine-Grained Classification Using Deep Metric Learning

## Overview
This project aims to build an effective model for classifying anomalies in mechanical components using **Deep Metric Learning**. The model is particularly useful for fine-grained classification where traditional methods may struggle due to the high intra-class variance and low inter-class variance.

## Features
- **Triplet Loss Function**: Utilizes a loss function that optimizes distance measurements, improving model accuracy in distinguishing between similar classes.
- **Embedding Model**: Maps input data into a feature space where learned distance metrics can effectively differentiate between different categories.
- **Performance Improvement**: Outperforms traditional cross-entropy loss in classification tasks for complex data distributions.
